# JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, text-based, interpreted, compiled programming language. JavaScript is based on the ECMAScript Language Specs.(doc ECMA-262). and ECMAScript Internationalization API specs. (doc ECMA 402) for its standards. JS can be used on the server-side and client-side and allows you to make webpages interactive by adding another tool to HTML and CSS. JS adds features such as real-time refresh of feeds, adding search bars to various websites, and adding embedded videos.

Any new variable in JS must be declared first before it is manipulated

## JS variables can be:

* Strings

* Functions

* Arrays

* Numbers

* Objects


## Deeper Dive

Strings are enclosed in quotes (either single or double quotes)

Functions are code specifically to accomplish one task. Functions invoke when activated/called.

Arrays are used to store/hold multiple values for a single variable.

Objects can contain many values

Numbers can be written with or without decimals
