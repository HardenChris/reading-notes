## Chap 3 - Lists / HTML & CSS

### HTML provides three types of lists

**Ordered Lists ```<ol>- numbered lists**

* ```<ol>```
* ```<li> words```
* ```<li> go```
* ```<li> here```
* ```<ol>```

would make a list that looks like this:

1. words
2. go
3. here
<br>
<br>

**Unordered Lists```<ul>- they use bullet points.**

* ```<ul>```
* ```<li> Even```
* ```<li> more```
* ```<li> words```
* ```<ul>

will give you a list like this:

* Even
* more
* words
<br>
<br>

**Definition Lists```<dl>- are made of terms and their defintions.**

* ```<dl>```
* ```<dt>Word<dt>```
* ```<dd>This is words definition.<dd>```
* ```<dl>```

this is how that code will look


Word 
>This is words definition


**NestedList**
list can be nested one inside of the other

## Chap 13 Boxes / HTML & CSS

* **min-width and max-width** - gives dimensions to maintain a certain size for boxes.
* **min-height and max-height** - same thing for height.
* **Overflow** -tells the browser what to do  with contwent thats too big for the box. **Hidden** hides the spare content. **Scroll** makes the hidden content a scrollable section.

## Chap 2 Basic JS instructions / JS & JQUERY

Array stores lists of values. 

## Chap 4 Decisions and Loops / JS & JQUERY

* **The If...else** statement checks on a condition

* **Switch Statements** -starts with a variable called the switch value.Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the ccode that should run if the variable matches that value.
* **Type Coercion & Weak Typing** -JS will try to make values make sense. so if you type a 1 JS will try to figure out what you mean by it.
* **Truthy & False values**  - 
* **Loops** - check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. The condition will be checked again and if it returns true again it will run again. types of loops in Js are:
* **For** - runs a loop a certain number of times.
* **While** - runs a loop whiile a certain consition is true.
* **Do While** - is very similiar to the while loop but will run at least once.
