# HTML Tables, JS function constructor

## Domain Modeling

* >**Domain Modeling** - is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem.

    - To me. Domain Modeling is agile programming where you slowly code more and morem to refine and construct around an issue.

## Ch.6 Tables / HTML & CSS

* >**Table** - represents info in a grid format. `<table>` 
    - `<tr>` - stands for table row and is written before you start a tables row.
    - `<td>` - stands for table data and is written before you start adding table data.
    - `<th>` - stands for table head and is placed at the beginning of a tAble column or row.
    - `<thead>` - the table header.
    - `<tbody>` - the container for the body.
    - `<tfoot>` - the container for the footer.

## Constructor Notation

* > The new keyword and the object constructor create a blank object. You can update property values with dot or square notation. And you can delete values as well.Example: 
    - `hotel.name = 'SouthPark'`
    - `hotel.['name'] = 'Southpark` 
    - `delete hotel.name;`  -> `hotel.name = '';`

* Global Scope - a function that is created at the top level of a script.

* When a function is defined inside of an object its now a method. 

## Three Groups pf built in objects

- **Browser Object Model** -creates a model of a browser tab or window.

- **Document Object Model** - creates a model of the current webpage.

- **Global Javasvript Objects** - doesnot form a single model, instead they are a group of individual objects that relate to differnt parts of the JS language. 





* **Object-Oriented Programming** -
