For loops – repeats until a specified condition evaluates to ‘false’
“for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
Statement”
When a for loop activates

1. The initialexpression if any is started. This will normally kick off one or more other operations
2. The condition expression is evaluated. If the value of the condition expression is true, the loop statements executes.
3. The statement activates to execute multiple statements.

While loop – executes as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.
“while (condition)
Statement”
The condition becomes false, statements within the loops stop executing and passe access to the statement that follows.
The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is activated. If the test results in true, statement is activated and the condition is run again. If the test returns false the activation stops ad the control passes the statement following while.
