# Component Lifecycle

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?

2. If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
   
    * Outside the <BrowserRouter/>

    * Inside the <BrowserRouter />, outside a <Route />
    
    * Inside a <Route />

3. What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested

4. What does props.children contain?

5. How do useState() and this.setState() differ?

## Define

* State Hook

* Mounting anf Un-Mounting
