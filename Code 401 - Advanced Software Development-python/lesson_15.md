# Trees

## Common Terms

>Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain its own values, and references to other nodes

>Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree

>K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.

>Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree

>Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree

>Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node

>Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children

>Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf
   
### Sample Tree from the text

![BinaryTree](/assets/images/BinaryTree1.png)

### Traversals

- traversals occur either by:

    - depth first
    - breadth first

### Depth First

- is broken down to three options for traversing:
  - Pre-Order
  - In-Order
  - Post-Order

### Breadth First
