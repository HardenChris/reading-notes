Markdown is a simple code source format used to create a simplistic website. The information once rendered changes plain text into adjusted forms for viewing consumption. so for example:

instead of saying "Title" you would write `#Title`
adding the # makes the text large and shows it is a heading.

List of common code:

# 			- H1 Largest Header
##			- H2 Middle Header
###			- H3 Smallest Header
