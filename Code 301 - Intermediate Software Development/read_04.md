# React and Forms

## Forms

1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

- Controlled Component is the control set by React where only react controls the state nothing else.

2. Should we wait to store the user's responses from the form into a state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

- Making changes while they are being input is a faster response and is the new norm.

3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

- handleChange

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

1. Why would we use a ternary operator?

- simple our code to a single line for speed and efficiency.

2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:<br>
  ```if(x===y){```<br>
 ```console.log(true);```<br>
 ```} else {```<br>
 ```console.log(false);```<br>
 ```}```<br>

  ```x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)```
