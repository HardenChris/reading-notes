# Linked Lists

linked list is a dynamic data structure vs array which is a static data structure.,

linked lists takes bytes form all over so data is spread out. static data structure requires all data to be together for utilization.

linked list are made up of nodes. Which has a start node called the 'Head'.

Linked list nodes do not know the whole picture just worries about holding their information and saying where the next node is.

Singly linked lists - has a single path from head to null.

Doubly linked lists - Has a link to previous node and next node.

Circular linked lists - does not in in a null it loops around and calls back to itself.
