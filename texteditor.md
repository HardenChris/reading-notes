This article covers the differences in Text editors from the mindset that there is no true ‘perfect’ or ‘best’ text editor. The author seems to be of the opinion that what you like I a personal choice.

Some Text editors have nice features such as Complete which tries to predict how you will finish your line of code, Emmet which does short hand for scripting, Syntax highlighting which highlights different elements of code so they are easily identifiable.

All computers come with their own text editors but they are bare bones and not as easily usable.

The author gives a general overview of all the bigger text editors and the differences between Text editors and IDEs (Integrated Development Environment).
