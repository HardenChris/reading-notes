# Expressions and Operators

Expressions and Operators has both unary and binary operations, as well as a single special ternary operator. Any binary operation requires an operator butted up with two operands so one before and one after. On the other hand, any unary operator can have the operand added before or after the operator.
Assignment Operators

Assign a value to the left operand based on the value of the operand on the opposite side (the right). Most commonly used is the “=” which assigned the value of he right operand to the left side

- Assignment x = y x = y
- Addition assignment x += y x = x + y
- Subtraction assignment x -= y x = x – y
- Multiplication assignment x _= y x = x _ y
- Division assignment x /= y x = x / y
- Remainder assignment x %= y x = x % y
- Exponentiation assignment x **= y x = x ** y
- Left shift assignment x <<= y x = x << y
- Right shift assignment x >>= y x = x>> y
- Unassigned right shift assignment x >>>= y x = x >>> y
- Bitwise AND assignment x &= y x = x & y
- Bitwise XOR assignment x ^= y x = x ^ y
- Bitwise OR assignment x |= y x = x | y
- Logical AND assignment x &&= y x && (x = y)
- Logical OR assignment x ||= y x || (x = y)
- Logical nullish assignment x ??= y x ?? (x = y)
