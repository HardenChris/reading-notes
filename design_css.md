# What is CSS?

## CSS-Cascading Style Sheets. CSS adds styling from formatting the word layout, animations, etc…

CSS is a language based on rules. So, you figure out what you want to change and what rules to add to it to get your desired effect. The part you choose to work on is called the **Selector** (in ex:the h1).  The rules are called 
**Declarations** (in ex: from h1 to closing “}”). The **Property** is the variable you want to change (in ex: color & font-size) and the **Value** is what it will be set as(in ex: blue & 10em).

Example:

`h1 {

color: blue;

font-size: 10em;

}`

CSS Specs are developed by **CSS working Group** which is a part of **W3C**. The group is made up of various reps from the major browser vendor and some experts in the field. Their whole purpose is to ensure compatibility for all be it a new project or an old site. From this, we get a list such as Browser support information that will tell you what browsers will accept which declaration changes made by CSS.
