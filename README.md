### What Growth Mindset Means To Me?
Growth Mindset is the ability to see adversity and chanllenges as pumps to growth. It ia the ability to see issues as an opportunity instead of a dead end.

### Growth Minset Reminders
1. Rome was not built in a day. Amything worth having is worth working for and should be built with time and effort. 
2. Tomas Edison said 
>"I didnt fail, I just found 10,000 ways to not make a light bulb" Edison took his failures as a temporary thing thich would lead to the eventual result he wanted.
4. Personally when I joined the military I wasnt sure I would pass MArine Corps Bootcamp but eventually I did and excelled at many differnt areas including holding a lleadership position for alot of time there. imes get hard but if you can put one fooot in front of the other then it isnt over.
