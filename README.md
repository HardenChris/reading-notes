## What Growth Mindset Means To Me?

Growth Mindset is the ability to see adversity and challenges as bumps on the road to growth. It is the ability to see issues as an opportunity instead of a dead end.

## Growth Minset Reminders

1. Rome was not built in a day. Anything worth having is worth working for and should be built with time and effort.
2. There is a famous quote on the invention of the lightbulb in which Edison shows that a failure isnt really a fialure if you learn form it and move forward. The Quote is:
   > "I didnt fail, I just found 10,000 ways to not make a light bulb"
3. Personally when I joined the military I wasnt sure I would pass Marine Corps bootcamp, but eventually I did and excelled at many differnt areas including holding a leadership position for alot of my time there. When times get hard if you can put one foot in front of the other then it isnt over.
