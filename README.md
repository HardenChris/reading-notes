**What Growth Mindset Means To Me?**

Growth Mindset is the ability to see adversity and challenges as bumps on the road to growth. It is the ability to see issues as an opportunity instead of a dead end.

**Growth Mindset Reminders**

1. Rome was not built in a day. Anything worth having is worth working for and should be built with time and effort.
2. There is a famous quote on the invention of the lightbulb in which Edison shows that a failure isn't really a failure if you learn form it and move forward. The Quote is:
   > "I didn't fail, I just found 10,000 ways to not make a light bulb"
3. Personally when I joined the military I wasn't sure I would pass Marine Corps bootcamp, but eventually I did and excelled at many different areas including holding a leadership position for a lot of my time there. When times get hard if you can put one foot in front of the other then it isn't over.

**My Name is...**
