# Git Tutorial: A comprehensive Guide

GGit is an offspring of Bitkeeper, which is no longer in use. One of the main features of ‘Git’ is version control. Version control is keeping track of multiple changes to a file(s) to see changes and iterations. Previous versions of version control include Local Version control - which was simplistic but had no redundancies, Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS), and Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS). DVCS are notable since they are redundant in the sense that repos are not kept local but on multiple servers with backups so there will always be access to them in any case.

Git is a DVCS that uses commits to annotate changes and track files. Commits are an image of how a file looks at a given moment in time. Because Git tracks changes it can compare every change against the main and hopefully catch any errors or flaws. In Git data can only be in three possible stages, staged, modified, or committed.

## Notable commands in Git:

* $ git config –list - pulls config notes

* git help command

* git clone (url) - pulls a copy of repo to local

* git clone (url) NewName - pulls a copy of repo and renames it locally

* git add (filename) - add the file to ACP

* git add * - add all files to ACP

* git status - get status of repo in ACP steps

* git commit -m “comments” - add comments to commit

* git commit -a - commit all changes currently made

* git push origin master - push all changes to git repo
