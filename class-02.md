# Basics of HTML, CSS

Structural Markup: the elements that can use to describe both headings and paragraphs
Semantic Markup: which provides extra info; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is quotation (and who said it), the meaning of the acronyms, and so on.
HTML has six levels of headings from ‘<h1>’ to ‘<h6>’. H6 being the smallest.
Paragraphs are made by surrounding the text in a opening ‘<p>’ and closing ‘</p>’.
The same thing can be done with Bold ‘<b>’, Italics <i>, Superscript <sup>, and Subscript <sub>.
White space left in code will generally be treated as one space even if its multiple spaces or lines apart.
To change this, we can use a break ‘<br />’ to break the sentence and start a new paragraph anywhere.
‘<hr />’ is used to break a page into another break or change topics/themes
You can add a Strong emphasis in code by wrapping it in ‘<strong>’
There is also use Emphasis ‘<em>’ as long as it is wrapped as such
Blockquotes ‘<blockquote>’are an extended length of quote that encompass an entire paragraph. While shorter quotes that sit inside of a paragraph are wrapped in ‘<q>’.
