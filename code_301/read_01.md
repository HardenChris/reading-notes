# Introduction to React and Components

## Component-Based Architecture

* **Component-based Architecture** - is the decomposition of the design into logical or small individual functional components that signify/represent  defined communication interfaces that contain methods, properties, and events. Allowing a breakdown of larger issues into smaller issues/problems.

* Component Reusability - which is the main focus of component-based architecture. To encapsulate the behavior and functionality of a software element into a reusable and self-deployable binary unit.

* **What is a “component”?**

  * A component is a replaceable, modular, portable, and reusable set of strongly defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exports it to a higher-level interface.

  * A component is a software object, intended to interact with various other components, encapsulating functionality of a group or functionalities.

  * A software component is a unit of composition with a specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. Software components are subject to composition by third parties and may be deployed individually.

* **What are the characteristics of a component?**

  * **Independent** - Components are designed to not rely on other components with the bare minimum amount of required overlap.

  * **Extensible** - A component may be extended from another/existing component to provide new/more behaviors.

  * **Reusability** - Components are designed with flexibility in mind to be used more than once if need be so they can serve a greater purpose. That being said some components are made for strict specific tasks.

  * **Not Context-Specific** - Components are designed to work they are needed be it in various environments or contextual applications.

  * **Replaceable** - Components can be swapped out with other similar components.

  * **Encapsulated** - A component shows the interfaces/interactions which allow the caller to use its functionalities, and does not expose inner details or internal states, or variables.

* **What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?**

  * **Reliability** - Every reliable component adds to the reliability of the whole.

  * **Reduced Cost** - The use of third-party components decreases overall costs

  * **Independent** - Flexibility connectivity and independence of components.

  * **Ease Of Deployment** - With newer components hitting the market replacing individual components is easy and does not usually cause conflicts.

  * **Ease of Development** - Components implemented with established interfaces to provide defined functionality.

  * **Reusable** -Components can be reused as needed thus reducing cost.

  * **System Maintenance and Evolution** - Ease to update or change the implementation without breaking other systems.

  * **Modification of technical complexity** - A component modifies the complexity using containers and their services.

## What is “Props” and how to use it in React?

**What are “props” short for?** - is a shorthand for properties, and is often used when passing data from one component to another.

**How are props used in React?**

1. Define an attribute and its data (value)

2. Pass the component using Props

3. Render the Data.

**What is the flow of props?**

* Props transfer data uni-directional flow(one way only, from parent to child.)
