# REST

1. Who is Roy Fielding?

    - "Some Guy. He's smart" lol. Jk jk. (He was a programmer who wrote some of the first web servers that actually sent docs across the web. He followed this up by doing alot of research and explaining why the internet works the way it does.)

2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

    - Modern connections are made for more limited groups since talking to all machines in the world was not a requirement. 

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

    - used for applying verbs to nouns when on a website.

4. What does a GET do?

    - retrieves information from the source

5. What does a POST do?

    - Create new information

6. What does PUT do?

    - Replaces some stated information 

7. What does PATCH do?
