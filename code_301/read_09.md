# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

1. What is functional programming?

    - >Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

    - It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
    - It does not cause any observable side effects

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?

    - code is easier to test 

4. What is immutability?

    - > When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

5. What is Referential transparency?

     - > pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

1. What is a module?

    - is separate piece of JS code for a different/specific function.

2. What does the word ‘require’ do?

    - is on the global JS pulling modules for use in another module.
3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

    - using require and making sure that the required module is exported.
4. What do we have to do to make a module available?

    - make sure its exported/
