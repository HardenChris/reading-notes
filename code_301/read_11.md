# Mongo and Mongoose

## SQL vs NoSQL

* SQL database are called Relational Database (RDBMS) vs NoSQL are called non-relational/distributed database.

* SQL database are based on tables vs NoSQL are based on document based, graph database, key-value pairs, wide-column stores.

* SQL database have predefined schema vs NoSQL   are dynamic schema  for data that is unstructured.

* SQL database are scaled vertically vs NoSQL which scaled horizontally.

* SQL data base use Structured Query Language (SQL) for manipulating and defining the data vs NoSQL  queries are focused on collections of documents.

* What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
  * data which is displayed as numbers and rows or heavy duty transactional type applications.

* Give a real world example.
  * MySQL Community Edition, Oracle Express Edition, MS-SQL Server Express Edition

* What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
  * hierarchical data that follows key-value pairs like a JSON

* Give a real world example.
  * MongoDB & CouchDB

* Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
  * NoSQL

* Which type of database is best for scalability?
  * Vertically SQL, horizontally NoSQL

* What does SQL stand for?
  * Structured Query Language - ex: `SELECT id, name, price FROM products`

* What is a relational database?
  * works with certain assumptions or pre designed set up

* What type of structure does a relational database work with?
  * relational schema like 'one-to-one', 'onw-to-many', 'many-to-many'

* What is a ‘schema’?
  * data layout & design

* What is a NoSQL database?
  * stores data in a database, which has collections, which store documents. There is no set schema. No relations

* How does it work?
  * less relation data but still access and flexibility

* What is inside of a Mongo database?
  * Database, Collections, Documents

* Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
  * SQL has schema which makes it easy to use but oSQL has less rules.

* What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
  * No relations, can have different levels of data compared to other data around it.
