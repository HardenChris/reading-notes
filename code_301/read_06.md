## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

    1. Greater Efficiency
    2. Engaged Collaboration
    3. Learning from fellow Students
    4. Social Skills
    5. Job interview readiness
    6. Work environment readiness

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

    - Greater efficiency has been the best asset to me. When I code with others I tend to have someone who catches my minor errors and i catch others errors faster so its a quick turn around time for coding. Since the review process is constant more or less.

3. How does pair programming work?

    - Pair programming works by having one person code while another person speaks. The one on the keyboard is called the Driver while the person explaining/directing is called the navigator.
