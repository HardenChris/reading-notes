# Intro to HTML and JS

## HTML Structure

* HTML describes the structure of the pages
* HTML elements are items like \<body>, \<main>, \<h1>, etc.
* Elements are made of opening and closing tags.
* The opening \<html> tag indicates anything between it is HTML code
* \<body> is the context that is visible on the page
* \<head> shows info. about the page but not info. That will physically show on the page.
* \<title> shows the main title on top of the browser

## Extra Markup

* DOCTYPES (<!DOCTYPE >)- tells the browser which version of HTML needs to be used.
* \<!--  -->  lets you add comment to your code
* ID – can be used anywhere in the code to add attributes
* CLASS – can also be used anywhere to add attributes but adds it to more then one item so often a better use over ID
* Block level items – will always start a new line and take up as much room as possible
* Inline items – will take up the minimum amount of room and not start a new line
* \<div> allows you to group a set of elements together in one block level
* \<span> inline version of div
* \<iframe> is a Picture in picture where a a new 0pae opens in your page, (usually contains items like: src, height, width, scrolling, frameborder, and in cases of HTML5 seamless)
* \<meta> lives in the \<head> and contains information on the page. Used by search engines for info on the page including, description, keywords, robots, author, pragma, expires)
* ESCAPE CHARACTERS – used when you cannot write something such as <> you write lt&; gt&;

## HTML5 Layout

* HTML5 has new elements which replace many div work that is currently used such as \<article> (which act as containers for any selections of a page that could stand alone and potentially syndicated.), \<aside> (when used inside an article  it contains information to the article, but can also be used outside of an article and be a sidebar), \<section> (groups related content together), \<hgroup> (is to group together a set of one or more \<h1>, … elements. So they are treated as a single heading.)
* In HTML5 uses the same header, footer, nav, as older HTML.
HTML 5 has embedded code to allow older browsers to read it and convert items as needed.
