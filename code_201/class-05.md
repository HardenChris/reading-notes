# HTML images, CSS text and color

## Ch.5 Images / HTML & CSS

* **Stock Images** - place holder image to use until a real photo can be added.

* Adding images using code. Below is an example where we are using a place holder image and setting a height and width to it. Example:

  * `<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" width="300 height=""250">`

* Selecting image format:

  * for an image with a lot of colors use JPEG.

  * for an image with few colors use GIF or PNG.

## Ch.11 Color / HTML & CSS

* **Foreground Color** - the basic command of `color` applies to the foreground element. That element being text. Color can be chosen in many ways from name value, RGB value, or HEX code.

* **Background Color** - CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box. The background color is the color of that box.

* Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing Red, Green, and Blue.

* **HSL Colors** - CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using hue, saturation, and lightness values.

## Ch.12 Text / HTML & CSS

* **Typeface Terminology**:
  * Serif - in print, serif fonts were traditionally used for long passages of text because they were considered easier to read.

  * Sans-Serif - easier to read on screen since screens can have lower resolution.

  * Monospace - is mainly used for coding since it aligns nicely.

  * Weight - adds emphasis and also adds white and black contrast.

  * Style - style changes how text looks italics look closer to cursive.

  * Stretch - focuses on spacing of lettering and words.

## JPEG vs PNG vs GIF — which image format to use and when?

* Use JPEG for most image with a lot of color.

* Use PNG for simple images with not a lot of color.

* Use GIFs for animated images.
